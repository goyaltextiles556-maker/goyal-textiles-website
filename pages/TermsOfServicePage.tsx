          3. Products & Pricing
        </h2>
        <p>
          We make reasonable efforts to display product descriptions, images, and

          4. Orders, Payment & Billing
        </h2>
        <p>

          We reserve the right to refuse, limit, or cancel any order at our sole
          discretion, including orders suspected of fraud, misuse, bulk resale,

          method.
